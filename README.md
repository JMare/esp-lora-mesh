ESP-IDF Based Lora Mesh Networking System
====================

The goal of this project is to create a system to enable creation of self healing self learning mesh networks that enable relativly high network capacity over a small area.

Written in C++ for ESP-IDF V4.0

Working so far:
- Basic C++ Lora Driver tested on SX1276 written to allow sharing of SPI bus with other devices
